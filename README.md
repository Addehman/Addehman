## Greetings! üëã

**My name is Adam Forsell!**  
I'm a Game Designer and Developer - I have a BA and a MS in Games Design, and am currently doing a Vocational Education (VET) called Game Creator Programmer at Yrgo, Gothenburg!
It only seemed natural for me to hop on over to coding now as I want to be able to actually make games, not just in my head! üòÅ<p>&nbsp;</p>


Here you can find some of my repositories for the projects that I have or are working on! 
* [The Unwanted Helper (Spidergame - Arachnophobia Studios)](https://github.com/Addehman/Arachnophobia-Studios)
* [Were.Wolf](https://github.com/MrJackey/Were.Wolf)
* [A Childhood Memory(Project-Well)](https://github.com/tzaarela/AChildhoodMemory)
<p>&nbsp;</p>


If you are looking to **Play** any of my games, head over to my itch.io-page:
